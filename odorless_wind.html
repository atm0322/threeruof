<h1>Odorless Wind</h1>

<p>
I am a moody person. On Sunday around 1:30 pm, the air feels neither cold nor warm. On the way back home, there were three men building a beige colored undefinable metal structure on the patio. Low mountain, saturated sky, scattered clouds. All were framed by the structure which made me all of sudden conscious of the relaxed green surrounding landscape. Have been staying here for about 6 months, but still, have a feeling of being vacation. Weird. Now I feel positive about being in this isolated area. </p>
