<h1>Slippery Lamps</h1>

<p>
I am a indecisive person. In the middle of the night, can’t remember the time, a photo stopped my finger scrolling down. It was the photo of the window with view of buildings, lights, and movement. I grew up in the city with The Noise. Lined up buildings, cars, and pedestrians. If someone asks me when do I feel relaxed, I would say when I’m in the middle of the city. The noise of cars and people.  The place I feel comfortable. The noise keeps distracting me from ‘floating’ thinkings, but also drags me into another pool to swim through. I like distraction. I am a city person.
